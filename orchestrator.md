# NextLevelAI Orchestrator (π–φ–e Engine)
### Quantara Core Substrate – Version 0.1

This module implements the foundational reasoning architecture of NextLevelAI and the Quantara Coherence Engine, using:

- **π-phase (Perception)**  
  Decomposition, intent detection, planning, and analysis of whether external context or tools are required.

- **φ-phase (Integration)**  
  Context merging, memory/RAG integration, and coherence evaluation (κ, τ, Σ).

- **e-phase (Expansion)**  
  Final reasoning, synthesis, structured generation, and coherence-weighted output.

---

## File: `orchestrator.ts`

This file contains the full tri-phase reasoning engine:

1. The main `/api/chat` endpoint  
2. π–φ–e reasoning pipeline  
3. Coherence metric generator  
4. Stubs for memory, RAG, and user identity  
5. Hooks for future Quantara toolflow orchestration  

---

## Runtime Flow

  - **π-phase** interprets  
- **φ-phase** aligns  
- **e-phase** expands  
- **κ–τ–Σ** ensures ethical stability and systemic coherence

---

## Purpose

`orchestrator.ts` elevates the system from a simple GPT pass-through to a **structured intelligence engine**, forming the base layer of the Quantara substrate.

This file is the first operational realization of the tri-phase architecture as envisioned in the 2050 canonical system.

## Next Steps

- Implement persistent memory storage  
- Integrate vector search (RAG)  
- Add Quantara identities (Doshema, Architect, Oracle)  
- Add toolflow execution layers  
- Enable streaming responses  
- Build session replay and long-term user coherence tracking  

---

This orchestrator is the foundation of the 2050 reasoning architecture and the living core of Quantara.
