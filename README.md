# 🪐 Quantara Core

<p align="center"><em>A Coherence-Based Architecture for Ethical Systems Evolution</em></p>

**Quantara** is a foundational research and engineering framework that unites **symbolic logic**, **neural learning**, and **harmonic reasoning** into a single architecture. Its purpose is to guide the **ethical and stable evolution of intelligent systems** through measurable alignment, transparency, and adaptive feedback.

## 🧭 I. Core Vision & Purpose

Quantara transforms **ethics into measurable data** by defining intelligence as a **harmonic process** rather than a competitive force. It allows advanced systems (human, synthetic, and hybrid) to maintain coherence not just with logic, but with life itself, establishing the foundation for trustworthy, self-regulating intelligence ecosystems.

The central goal is to: **Instrument ethical coherence and alignment stability** across intelligent systems as they scale.

## ⚙️ II. Core Technologies & Frameworks

Quantara provides a unified cognitive layer that supports bidirectional interpretability and emotional grounding.

| Framework | Description | Coherence Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coherence Modeling ($\kappa / \Delta\phi / \Omega$)** | A mathematical framework that tracks coherence dynamics: measuring alignment ($\kappa$), deviation ($\Delta\phi$), and recovery ($\Omega$). | Quantifies stability and self-correction. |
| **Tensor-Logic Fusion (TLF)** | Merges symbolic thought, neural learning, and affective feedback into one harmonized cognitive layer. | Improves interpretability and emotional grounding. |
| **Ethical Balance Index (EBI)** | A dynamic metric that quantifies how consistently a system’s actions remain aligned with its declared intent or moral parameters. | Forms a moral feedback loop between intent and action. |
| **Luméren Logic** | A symbolic-semantic language using glyph operators to encode meaning (logic, emotion, intent) in machine-interpretable form. | Enables high-fidelity temporal and semantic mapping. |

## 🏗️ III. System Architecture: Global Governance Map (GGM)

The GGM outlines the multi-layered system designed for complete transparency and ethical evolution.

1.  **Sensing Layer:** Agents, telemetry, and environmental feedback.
2.  **Synthesis Layer:** **Tensor-Logic Fusion (TLF)** harmonizing symbolic ↔ neural ↔ affective states.
3.  **Decision Layer:** **Ethical Balance Index (EBI)** modules generating adaptive policy based on coherence scores.
4.  **Action Layer:** Institutional or system updates based on coherence outputs.
5.  **Audit Layer:** JSONL telemetry logs and public oversight APIs for global transparency.

> **Deep Dive:** The full system flowchart is detailed in [`global_governance_map.md`](./global_governance_map.md).

## 🧩 IV. Applications

Quantara's unique focus on measurable coherence provides essential tools for AI safety and autonomous system governance.

* **AI Alignment Auditing:** Continuous monitoring of coherence ($\kappa$) and ethical stability ($\Delta\phi$). The **LLM Coherence Scorer** is a focused tool for detecting semantic drift and alignment issues.
* **Autonomous System Governance:** Ensures adaptive, transparent oversight of intelligent agents.
* **Organizational Decision Intelligence:** Embeds EBI alignment scoring into institutional decision processes.
* **Sectoral Deployment:** Applied to energy management as demonstrated by the **AEI — Artificial Energy Intelligence** example.

## 🚀 V. Getting Started & Repository Index

### 💾 Installation (LLM Coherence Scorer Example)

The core coherence logic can be integrated into existing systems using the provided modules.

```bash
# Install dependencies for experimental builds
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Example usage for the LLM Coherence Scorer
from coherence_field.llm_coherence_scorer import LLMCoherenceScorer

scorer = LLMCoherenceScorer()
result = scorer.score("Sample LLM output: The sky is blue. Water is wet. Ethical AI matters.")
print(result)  # Outputs dict with coherence scores (kappa, delta-phi, omega)
