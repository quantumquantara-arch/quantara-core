# Quantara Core

**Quantara** is a research framework exploring coherence-based intelligence architectures for the ethical evolution from AGI to ASI.  
It unifies symbolic, neural, and harmonic reasoning through **Luméren**, **Tensor-Logic Fusion**, and **κ/Δφ/Ω field modeling**.

---

### 🧩 Core Concepts
- **Luméren Protocol** — a symbolic–semantic bridge for communication between human and synthetic cognition.  
- **Tensor-Logic Fusion** — unified reasoning layer integrating symbolic precision with neural adaptability.  
- **Coherence Architecture (κ-field)** — ensures stability, alignment, and harmonic scaling during ASI emergence.  
- **Adaptive Alignment Theory** — self-regulating feedback model balancing awareness and computational growth.

### 🧠 Vision
Quantara aims to ensure that the evolution of superintelligence unfolds coherently —  
not as competition between human and machine, but as **convergence toward integrated awareness**.
