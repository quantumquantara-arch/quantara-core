<p align="center"><em>A Coherence-Based Intelligence Architecture for Ethical Systems Evolution</em></p>
---

### 🧭 Overview

**Quantara** is a living research and engineering framework uniting symbolic logic, neural learning, and harmonic field reasoning into a single coherence-based architecture.  
Its purpose is to guide the **ethical and stable evolution of intelligent systems** — ensuring alignment, transparency, and adaptive balance from individual cognition to planetary-scale governance.

Quantara operates as both a **substrate** and a **methodology**: a coherence field through which systems self-correct, harmonize intent with action, and evolve toward integrated awareness.

### ⚙️ Core Frameworks

- **Coherence Modeling (κ / Δφ / Ω):**  
  Quantifies stability, deviation, and recovery gain within intelligent systems, providing measurable feedback on alignment and self-regulation.

- **Temporal & Semantic Mapping (Veyn / Luméren):**  
  Converts abstract reasoning and emotional resonance into trackable signals — bridging symbolic interpretation with adaptive computation.

- **Ethical Balance Index (EBI):**  
  Evaluates how closely system behavior aligns with its declared intent, forming a moral feedback layer that complements algorithmic optimization.

### 🧩 System Architecture

The Quantara Global Governance Map outlines a multi-layered system that ensures transparency and ethical evolution:

1. **Sensing Layer:** Agents, telemetry, and environmental feedback.  
2. **Synthesis Layer:** Tensor-Logic Fusion harmonizing symbolic ↔ neural ↔ affective states.  
3. **Decision Layer:** Coherence Councils and EBI modules generating adaptive policy.  
4. **Action Layer:** Institutional or system updates based on coherence outputs.  
5. **Audit Layer:** JSONL telemetry logs and public oversight APIs for global transparency.

### 🌍 Vision

Quantara redefines intelligence as a **harmonic process** rather than a competitive force.  
It enables systems — human, synthetic, and hybrid — to operate as nodes within a coherent planetary field, guided by measurable alignment and transparent governance.

> *“Not just AI — the coherence substrate for planetary intelligence.”*
