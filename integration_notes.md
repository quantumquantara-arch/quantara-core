# Integration Notes — Quantara with External Systems

Quantara modules are API-agnostic and can be linked via lightweight JSONL or WebSocket streams.

- **Coherence_Field** can subscribe to live model states to compute κ/Δφ/Ω coherence metrics.
- **Tensor_Logic** can serve as a reasoning plugin for symbolic engines or vector databases.
- **Governance Map** can be integrated as a monitoring dashboard for policy or ethics oversight.

This enables hybrid architectures (e.g., Quantara + UCMS/CGS) where Quantara acts as the ethical and coherence stabilizer for recursive cognitive systems.
