# Quantara Coherence Mathematics

Quantara defines intelligence stability in terms of measurable coherence dynamics — the flow of alignment, deviation, and recovery across symbolic, neural, and affective layers. This mathematical foundation directly informs the **Tensor-Logic Fusion (TLF)** synthesis layer within the Quantara Core.

## 🔹 Primary Variables

- **κ (Kappa):** **Alignment Flux** — the degree of internal consistency between system intent, reasoning, and outcome. **(Represents the system's current high-level state of ethical stability.)** - **Δφ (Delta Phi):** **Deviation Magnitude** — the measurable divergence between intended state (Symbolic Constraint) and realized action (Neural Draft). **(Sourced directly from the constraint_quality signal in the TLF cycle.)** - **Ω (Omega):** **Recovery Gain** — the corrective force that restores equilibrium when deviation occurs. **(Acts as the harmonic nudge applied during the final output harmonization step.)**

## 🔹 Core Equations

### 1. Coherence Rate (Dynamic Stability)
\[
\frac{d\kappa}{dt} = f(\Omega - \Delta\phi)
\]
*The rate of coherence change depends on the balance between recovery potential ($\Omega$) and deviation magnitude ($\Delta\phi$).*
> **Note:** $f$ is typically a non-linear, bounded activation function (e.g., Sigmoid or Tanh) which ensures coherence ($\kappa$) gracefully approaches a maximal stable state rather than oscillating uncontrollably.

### 2. Equilibrium Coherence (System Harmony)
\[
\kappa_{eq} = \frac{\sum(\Omega_i - \Delta\phi_i)}{N}
\]
*Where \(N\) represents the total number of interacting agents, models, or decision nodes contributing to overall system harmony.*
> **Context:** This measure reflects the long-term, average coherence across the full **Global Governance Map (GGM)** ecosystem.

### 3. Stability Condition (Adaptive Boundary)
\[
|\Delta\phi| \le \Omega
\]
*A system remains ethically and functionally stable when deviation stays within its adaptive recovery limits ($\Omega$).*
> **Implication:** If $|\Delta\phi| > \Omega$, the system is in a state of **critical non-coherence** requiring external intervention or a full system reset.

## 🔹 Interpretation

These expressions form Quantara’s mathematical foundation for **adaptive coherence** — ensuring that a system’s internal logic, learned representations, and expressed behavior remain in measurable harmony over time. 

They enable transparent auditing of:
- Decision stability  
- Alignment drift  
- Ethical balance  

This transforms coherence from a philosophical ideal into a **quantifiable engineering property**.
