# Quantara Coherence Mathematics

Quantara defines intelligence stability in terms of measurable coherence dynamics — the flow of alignment, deviation, and recovery across symbolic, neural, and affective layers.

## 🔹 Primary Variables

- **κ (Kappa):** Alignment flux — the degree of internal consistency between system intent, reasoning, and outcome.  
- **Δφ (Delta Phi):** Deviation — the measurable divergence between intended state and realized action.  
- **Ω (Omega):** Recovery gain — the corrective force that restores equilibrium when deviation occurs.

## 🔹 Core Equations

### 1. Coherence Rate
\[
\frac{dκ}{dt} = f(Ω - Δφ)
\]
The rate of coherence change depends on the balance between recovery potential (Ω) and deviation magnitude (Δφ).

### 2. Equilibrium Coherence
\[
κ_{eq} = \frac{∑(Ω_i - Δφ_i)}{N}
\]
Where \(N\) represents the total number of interacting agents, models, or decision nodes contributing to overall system harmony.

### 3. Stability Condition
\[
|Δφ| ≤ Ω
\]
A system remains ethically and functionally stable when deviation stays within its adaptive recovery limits.

## 🔹 Interpretation

These expressions form Quantara’s mathematical foundation for **adaptive coherence** — ensuring that a system’s internal logic, learned representations, and expressed behavior remain in measurable harmony over time.

They enable transparent auditing of:
- Decision stability  
- Alignment drift  
- Ethical balance  

This transforms coherence from a philosophical ideal into a **quantifiable engineering property**.
