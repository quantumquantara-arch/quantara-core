κ = ∑(alignment_flux) / Δφ²  
Δφ = deviation between internal state φᵢ and external field φₑ  
Ω = bounded recovery gain ensuring ∂κ/∂t → equilibrium

dκ/dt = f(Ω - Δφ) defines the adaptive correction cycle.

This model supports dynamic equilibrium across symbolic, neural, and affective layers, harmonized via Tensor-Logic recursion.
