## Purpose
Quantara is an open research framework designed to study and instrument *ethical coherence and alignment stability* across intelligent systems.  
It models how symbolic reasoning, neural learning, and moral feedback interact to sustain interpretability, safety, and adaptive consistency as intelligence scales.

## Core Elements

**1. Coherence Metrics (κ / Δφ / Ω)**  
Quantitative indicators of alignment, deviation, and recovery. These metrics enable empirical tracking of system drift, feedback stability, and ethical self-correction.

**2. Tensor-Logic Fusion (TLF)**  
A unification layer integrating symbolic, neural, and affective reasoning. TLF supports bidirectional interpretability — symbolic transparency for neural processes and dynamic learning for abstract logic.

**3. Ethical Balance Index (EBI)**  
A dynamic model translating moral and behavioral feedback into measurable stability data. EBI provides a closed feedback loop between system intent, action, and perceived outcome.

**4. Global Governance Map (GGM)**  
A multi-layer architecture for representing ethical sensing, decision-making, and audit transparency across distributed AI systems.

## Methods
Quantara applies harmonic feedback theory and coherence field modeling to derive real-time measures of stability and self-alignment.  
It combines symbolic-neural simulations with modular pseudocode implementations for κ-space modeling, EBI calculations, and recursive Δφ adjustment.  
All models are designed for transparency, interpretability, and empirical reproducibility.

## Potential Applications
- Monitoring and mitigation of alignment drift in large language models  
- Ethical interpretability metrics for reinforcement learning agents  
- Adaptive control and feedback mechanisms for autonomous decision systems  
- Governance simulation and meta-alignment modeling across multi-agent environments

## Relevance to Alignment Research
Quantara’s approach aligns with ongoing interpretability and AI safety work at **Anthropic**, **OpenAI**, and **xAI** by providing a *coherence instrumentation substrate* capable of quantifying moral stability and recursive feedback behavior.  
It supports the development of steerable, trustworthy, and transparent AI through measurable coherence rather than external control.
